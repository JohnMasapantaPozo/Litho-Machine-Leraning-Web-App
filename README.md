## Getting started

### Users:

The application was created, deployed, and hosted by Streamlit.
If you want to try the web application follow the link. [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/johnmasapantapozo/litho-machine-leraning-web-app/root/main.py).

### Developers:

* If you want to play with the code you could clone the whole repository to your local machine by:

    * `git clone https://github.com/JohnMasapantaPozo/Litho-Machine-Leraning-Web-App.git`
 
* Once you have cloned the repository, you need to reproduce the proper environment needed by the application. Open your command prompt CMD and recreate the environment by using the 'environment.yml' file:

    * 'conda env create -f environment.yml'

* Once everithing is set you could interact with the code locally and run the app locally by:
    * 'streamlit run main.py'
